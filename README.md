# SVM-and-NN

Non linear models for classification

In this notebook we are going to explore the use of SVM and Neural Networks for image classification. We are going to use the famous MNIST dataset, that is a dataset of handwritten digits. We get the data from mldata.org, that is a public repository for machine learning data.
